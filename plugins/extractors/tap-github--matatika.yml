  GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.
  ## Personal Access Token
  Github token to authenticate with. This token will need to be a Github Classic `Personal Access Token` scoped with everything you need access to.

  These scopes can range from being able to access public endpoints, for example for public repositories, to private repository and endpoint permissions.

  For a quick start if you are syncing a public repository (like the default Repositories value) the only required scope is `public_repo`.

  For help with this you can follow the Github [Creating a Classic Personal Access Token Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)
  ## Repositories
  Any number of github repositories to be included.

  Add a new repository in the `Add a value` box and then press the `+`, to remove from your list click the  `-` next to the repository.

  Example: `Matatika/matatika-ce`
