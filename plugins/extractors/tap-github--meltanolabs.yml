  GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.

  ## Prerequisites

  You will need a Github `auth_token` scoped with everything you need access to. For help with this you can follow the Github [Creating a Personal Access Token Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

  You will also need to provide one of the following settings: 
  - `Repositories`
  - `Organizations`
  - `Searches`
  - `User Usernames`
  - `User IDs`

  ## Auth Token

  Github token to authenticate with.

  ## Additional Auth Tokens

  List of GitHub tokens to authenticate with. Streams will loop through them when hitting rate limits.

  ## Rate Limit Buffer

  Add a buffer to avoid consuming all query points for the token at hand.

  ## Searches

  An array of search descriptor objects with the following properties. "name" - a human readable name for the search query. "query" -  a github search string (generally the same as would come after ?q= in the URL).

  ## Organizations

  An array of strings containing the github organizations to be included.

  Example: `["Matatika", "MatatikaBytes"]`

  ## Repositories

  An array of strings containing the github repos to be included.

  Example: `["Matatika/tap-spotify", "Matatika/tap-auth0"]`

  ## User Usernames

  An array of strings containing GitHub usernames.

  Example: `["user", "usertwo"]`

  ## User IDs

  A list of GitHub user ids.

  Example: `["12345", "54321"]`

  ## Start Date

  When to start syncing data from.

  ## Stream Maps

  Optional stream maps.

  ## Stream Map Config

  Configuration for your stream maps.

  ## Skip Parent Streams

  Set to true to skip API calls for the parent streams (such as repositories) if it is not selected but children are.
